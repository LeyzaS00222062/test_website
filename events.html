                May Day, in medieval and modern Europe, holiday (May 1) for the celebration of the return of spring. 
                The observance probably originated in ancient agricultural rituals, and the Greeks and Romans held such festivals. 
                Although later practices varied widely, the celebrations came to include the gathering of wildflowers and green branches, 
                the weaving of floral garlands, the crowning of a May king and queen, and the setting up of a decorated May tree, or Maypole, around which people danced. 
                Such rites originally may have been intended to ensure fertility for crops and, by extension, for livestock and humans, 
                but in most cases this significance was gradually lost, so that the practices survived largely as popular festivities.
